# Book Store. Spring Project

The purpose of this task is to check your knowledge and understanding in Java and Spring.

Duration: **15** hours

## Description

Your objective is to develop a "Book Store Service" following the MVC pattern.

> Project may have two main roles of authority: customer and employee.

The project structure is already set up, with essential classes waiting for implementation in their respective folders.
Your project is organized into several packages. Here's a brief overview of each:

### Packages Overview

#### `conf`

- Houses all configuration classes.

#### `controller`

- Contains controller files.

#### `dto`

- Contains DTO files.

#### `model`

- Contains all model classes.

#### `exception`

- Contains custom user exception files.

#### `repo`

- Contains repository files.

#### `service`

- Includes interfaces with declared methods for all services.

- `impl`: Encompasses implementations of declared services.

The class diagram of the Domain model is shown in the figure below:

## Requirements

Ensure implementation of the following:

- `Spring Data JPA` for efficient data management.
-  Incorporate `Spring Security` for robust authentication and authorization.
-  Enable `Internationalization and Localization` to support English and any language you choose.
-  Implement `Validation` for data integrity.
-  Establish `Error handling` for graceful error management.
-  Utilize `DTOs` - data transfer objects structured as illustrated below:

## Would be nice

Consider the following additional features:

- Incorporate `Logging` for comprehensive system monitoring.
- Implement `Pagination and Sorting` for enhanced data presentation.

## Recommendations

> Use wrapper classes (like Long, Integer, etc.) instead of primitive types whenever possible.

- Utilize `Lombok` for streamlined Java code.
- Use `ModelMapper` for easy mapping between objects.
- Utilize `Thymeleaf` for HTML templating.
- Explore the `test` folder to execute provided test cases for your solution.
- Refer to the `main\resources\sql` folder for SQL scripts to initialize data.

## Special message

- Make the most of the time available.
  While we understand you may not cover all the points,
  aim to accomplish as much as possible within the given duration of 15 hours.
